# machinelearning-coursera
This repository contains the exercises required for the Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

The repository are divided by weeks and each week contains the data, the exercise readme and an implementation on Octave and Python (using Jupyter Notebooks). The only exception is the week 1 that doesn't have exercises.
