# machinelearning-coursera
This repository contains the exercises required for the Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

The repository are divided by folder, with each folder containing one exercise. Inside each folder there's a pdf explaining the exercise, a Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation in Pyton and several functions implementing the exercise in Octave (as required by the course).

The exercises are:

**Exercise1 ([pdf](), [jupyter_notebook]()):** Implementing linear regression with one and multiple variables using gradient descent and normal equations to find the model parameters.

**Exercise2 ([pdf](), [jupyter_notebook]()):** Implementing a logistic regression model and a regularized logistic regression for classification.
