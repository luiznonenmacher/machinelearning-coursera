# machinelearning-coursera
This repository contains the exercises required for the Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

The repository are divided by folder, with each folder containing one exercise. Inside each folder there's a pdf explaining the exercise, a Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation in Pyton and several functions implementing the exercise in Octave (as required by the course).

The exercises are:

**Exercise1 ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex1/ex1.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex1/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)):** Implementing linear regression with one and multiple variables using gradient descent and normal equations to find the model parameters.

**Exercise2 ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex2/ex2.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex2/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)):** Implementing a logistic regression model and a regularized logistic regression for classification.
