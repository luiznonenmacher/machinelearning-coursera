# machinelearning-coursera
This repository contains the exercises required for the Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.

The repository are divided by folder, with each folder containing one exercise. Inside each folder there's a pdf explaining the exercise, a Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation in Pyton and several functions implementing the exercise in Octave (as required by the course).

The exercises are:

**1 - Linear Regression ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex1/ex1.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex1/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)):** Implementing linear regression with one and multiple variables using gradient descent and normal equations to find the model parameters.

**2 - Logistic Regression ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex2/ex2.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex2/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)):** Implementing a logistic regression model and a regularized logistic regression for classification. 

**3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex3/ex3.pdf), [notebook]https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex3/Multiclass%20Classification%20and%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)):** Implementing logistic regression and a trained neural network to multi-class classification.

**4 - Neural Networks Learning ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex4/ex4.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex4/Neural%20Networks%20Learning.ipynb)):** Training a neural network for multi-class classification.

**5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex5/ex5.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex5/Regularized%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Bias%20v.s.%20Variance.ipynb)):** Implementing a regularized linear regression (Ridge Regression) and using it to study the bias-variance tradeoff.

**6 - Support Vector Machines ([pdf](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex6/ex6.pdf), [notebook](https://github.com/luiznonenmacher/machinelearning-coursera/blob/master/ex6/Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb)):** Implementing Support Vector Machines with different kernels and using cross validation to optimize the hyperparameters.
